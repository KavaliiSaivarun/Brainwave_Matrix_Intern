# Library Management System

A comprehensive library management system that helps track books, members, categories, and borrowing records.

## Database Structure

The system consists of four main entities:

### Book Categories
- Unique category ID
- Category name
- Description
- Timestamp for category creation

### Books
- Unique book ID
- Title
- Author
- ISBN
- Published year
- Category reference
- Total copies
- Available copies
- Timestamp for book entry

### Members
- Unique member ID
- First name
- Last name
- Email address
- Phone number
- Join date
- Membership status
- Timestamp for member registration

### Borrowings
- Unique borrowing ID
- References to both book and member
- Borrow date
- Due date
- Return date
- Fine amount (if applicable)
- Status of the borrowing

## Features

- Book catalog management with categorization
- Member management system
- Borrowing and return tracking
- Fine calculation system
- Available copies tracking
- Membership status monitoring

## Technical Details

The system uses:
- Primary key constraints for unique identifiers
- Foreign key relationships between tables
- Timestamp tracking for all major operations
- Status enums for both membership and borrowing states
- Decimal precision for fine calculations

## Entity Relationships

1. Each book belongs to one category (Many-to-One)
2. Members can borrow multiple books (One-to-Many)
3. Books can be borrowed by multiple members over time (One-to-Many)
4. Borrowing records connect books with members (Many-to-Many bridge)
